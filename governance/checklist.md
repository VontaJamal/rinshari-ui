# Governance Checklist

Every principle/pattern update must satisfy:

- [ ] Evidence is present (transcript paraphrase and/or concrete implementation example).
- [ ] Intended UX effect is explicit.
- [ ] Accessibility implications are documented.
- [ ] Motion/animation implications are documented, including reduced-motion behavior when applicable.
- [ ] At least one failure mode/anti-pattern is documented.
- [ ] Guidance remains principle-first (not rigidly template-locked).
- [ ] Source trace is included.
