# 001 Seven Saints System

## Intent
Define a Commander-led Seven Saints doctrine for UI/design engineering so teams can execute with broad capability, focused priorities, and consistent cross-repo standards. Orchestration remains interleaved under Commander authority rather than becoming its own saint domain. AI is treated as a force multiplier under disciplined usage laws, not as an automatic substitute for design and engineering judgment.

## UX Effect
Increase product love and long-term usage by treating aesthetics, motion, accessibility, execution, testing, scale, and value as explicit governance domains. The expected effect is interfaces that feel intentional, delightful, understandable, and dependable while remaining practical to operate. AI-assisted work should accelerate quality outcomes while preserving trust, validation rigor, and fallback behavior.

## Accessibility Implication
Because animation and whimsical flourishes are first-class under Saint of Aesthetics, every motion decision must include reduced-motion handling, semantic alternatives, and non-motion communication paths so delight never blocks usability.

## Failure Modes / Anti-patterns
- Over-animation: adding flourishes without a user-facing purpose or reduced-motion fallback.
- Cargo-cult complexity: adopting distributed architecture or heavy systems before requirements justify them.
- Value-blind design: shipping visually impressive experiences that do not improve adoption, retention, or business outcomes.
- AI novelty without value: introducing AI because it is available instead of because it improves user or business outcomes.
- Unsafe data exposure: sending raw secrets, credentials, or sensitive user data to external AI systems.
- AI autopilot without validation: accepting generated outputs without independent verification or behavioral testing.
- Missing fallback: shipping AI-assisted flows without manual/degraded-mode behavior.
- Doctrine drift: treating saints as optional themes instead of enforceable delivery gates.
