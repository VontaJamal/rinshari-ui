# Changelog

All notable changes to `rinshari-ui` are tracked here.

## [Unreleased]
- Strengthened preflight and governance guidance to require an animation-first repository audit before UI/UX changes, plus explicit animation audit reporting in downstream PR/task output.
- Updated downstream bootstrap automation so managed AGENTS/PR templates and design-preflight CI checks require a non-empty animation audit summary section.
- Added `principles/` with foundational seed principle (`principles/000-foundations.md`) and index entry to restore downstream contract.
- Bootstrap repository structure, governance templates, and automation scripts.
